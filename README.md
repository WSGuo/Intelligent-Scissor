# Intelligent Scissor
Computer Vision project

In this project, we create a tool that allows a user to cut an object out of one image and paste it into another. The tool helps the user trace the object by providing a "live wire" that automatically snaps to and wraps around the object of interest. The user will then use his tools to create a composite image.
